# CSS-Crunch
*This is the readme file for a single functionality based implementation of "Crunch wordlister" which is a wordlist generator where you can specify a standard character set or a character set you specify to generate all possible combinations and permutations of passwords.*

*We have explored multiple functionalties of crunch and have implemented the functionality of multiple secure password generation based on user input to improve security of system(miniature version of this one functionality)*

*This is done by 4 students of LY KJ Somaiya CS branch as a part of an assignment of CSS(Cryptograpy and System Security). We learned about crunch from https://sourceforge.net/projects/crunch-wordlist/*

This github repository shows a python file named "crunch_wordlister.py" which takes input of word from user in 2 ways, through input.txt file or command line and generates a possible list of passwords based on minimum and maximum length using various permutations and combinations which are stored in a output.txt file.

The implementation serves the base purpose which is generation of wordlists that can be used as passwords and provide security to user. This fulfills the confidentiality goal of the CIA traid of system security.
